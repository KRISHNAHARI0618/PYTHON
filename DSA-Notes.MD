### Udemy Course DSA Python 
- Big O `worst case find out how to optimize`
- Big O(n) `Linear Structure`
- Drop Constants ` Constants does have much impact on program`
- Big(n^2) `Loop Inside Loop`
- Drop Non-Dominants ` O(n^2 + n) we will drop single n`
- Big O(1) `Simple Operations like addition etc ..`
- O(log n) ` Divide and Conquor - Sorting Algorithms`
- O(a+b) ` if iterations are different`
- O(a*b) ` if the lop iteratees inside for multiple times`


### Linked List
- Linnked list does not have indexes
- it will not store in contiguous locations
- it will have head and tail on is connecetd to another in the memory
- it is connected between the nodes
#### Big O Notation
- Node is pointer & value 
- Its is also a nested dictionary
-
