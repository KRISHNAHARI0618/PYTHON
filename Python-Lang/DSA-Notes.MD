### Udemy Course DSA Python 
- Big O `worst case find out how to optimize`
- Big O(n) `Linear Structure`
- Drop Constants ` Constants does have much impact on program`
- Big(n^2) `Loop Inside Loop`
- Drop Non-Dominants ` O(n^2 + n) we will drop single n`
- Big O(1) `Simple Operations like addition etc ..`
- O(log n) ` Divide and Conquor - Sorting Algorithms`
- O(a+b) ` if iterations are different`
- O(a*b) ` if the lop iteratees inside for multiple times`

### Linked List
- Linnked list does not have indexes
- it will not store in contiguous locations
- it will have head and tail on is connecetd to another in the memory
- it is connected between the nodes

- **What is Linked List**
- Linked list Is a Form of sequential collection and it does not have to be in order. A linked list is made up of independent nodes that may contain any type of data and each node has a reference of next node in the link
- Linked List is not contigious

- Types of Linked Lists:
  - Singly Linked List : Reference of last node is Null
  - Double Linked List : It contains the reference of previous node and next node
  - Circular Singly Linked list : reference of last node is First Node
  - Circularly Double Linked List: reference of last node is First node value
  
#### Big O Notation
- Node is pointer & value 
- Its is also a nested dictionary

### Hash Tables
- Collisions :
  - Seperate Chaining
    - 
- Linear Probing
```
class HashTable
```
### A Recipe for Problem Solving:
- **Understand the Problem**:
  - Can we restate the problem in our own words?
  - What are inputs that go into the problem?
  - What are output that come from the problem?
  - Can the outputs determined from the inputs provided
  - Do we have enough info to solve the problem?
  - what should i label the important piece of data that are part of a problem?
- **Explore the concrete examples**
  - start with simple examples
  - progress to more complex examples
  - explore with empty inputs
  - explore with invalid inputs
- **BreakDown the Problem**
  - Write out the steps that you need to take
- **Solve and Simplify**
  - Simplify the problem and write the simple steps
- **Look Back Refactor**
  - Improve the code and reduce the time complexity
  - Check result
  - try different ways
  - understand it a glance
  - how other poeple solve this problem
